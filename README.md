# fitcompare
Python tool to compare two FIT files data

This script is only intended to run in a docker image. Any other use is not supported.

=Build the Docker image=
1. Get the file fitcompare.py, Dockerfile and config.ini, place all the files in a directory
2. Create a Mapbox API and put it in the config.ini file
3. Build the Docker image using: docker build . -t fitcompare

=Run the container=
The long command to run the container is:
docker run -v .:/project fitcompare OPTIONS

I use to place someting like this in my .bashrc/.zshrc:

alias fitcompare="docker run -v .:/project fitcompare" 

This way, I can run only "fitcompare OPTIONS" in the directory where FIT files are 

Command line usage: 

usage: fitcompare [-h] [--reference-file REFERENCE_FILE]
                     [--prefix PROJECT_PREFIX] [--debug] [--export]
                     FITFILE [FITFILE ...]
                     
positional arguments:
  FITFILE               Fit Files to compare

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit (fully operational)
  --reference-file, -r REFERENCE_FILE 
                        Set the reference FIT File (fully operational)
  --prefix, -p PROJECT_PREFIX
                        Set the project prefix for output files (fully operational)
  --debug, -d           Enable debug (partly operational)
  --export, -e          Export graphs values also as CSV (partly operational)
  
FIT File name have to be correctly formatted:

<DEVICE_NAME>_<HR_DEVICE>_<GNSS_CONFIG>[_<OPTIONAL_DISTANCE_MEASUREMENT_DEVICE>].fit

Where:
<DEVICE_NAME> = Name without spaces
<HR_DEVICE> = Name without spaces
<GNSS_CONFIG> =  - SatIQ:    for Garmin SatIQ automatic
                 - Ultra:    for UltraTrack or equivalent
                 - GPS:      for GPS only
                 - GNSS:     for all GNSS systems
                 - GNSSDual: for all GNSS systems + GPS Multiband
                 - NONE:     for non GPS records
Example:

fitcompare -r SuuntoRace_PolarH10_GNSSDual_Stryd.fit GarminFenix9_OHR_GNSSDual.fit GarmninInstinct4_OHR_GNSSDual.fit -p compare_prototypes

In addition to command line, options can be configured in the project.yaml in the same directory:

project: # This is a section that configure global aspects of the project
  align: True/False # True is the default value, the one to compare two files generated at the same time. False is to compare differetn files from different time. For information only, cannot be a valid data processing, because fake data are added to the shorter file.
  zoom: [90, 120] # Zoom between two timestamps (relative seconds of activity)
  altitudeGap: 8  # Number of seconds ignored at the beginning of activity, if some files start at 0 altitude and then put the correct one.
  map: True/False # If a map should be generated. It is mandatory to put a map: False for activities without GPS data
  graphs: ['heart_rate', 'altitude', 'distance'] # Fields for which a graph shoud be generated
  includeSmoothedAlt: False #Â Should the data of smoothed altitude be included into the elevation graph
  
customGraphs: # In this section, we can configure custom graphs
  - name: Altitude baro vs GPS # Name of the custom graph
    values: # Values
      - file: GarminFenix8_WahooTRACKR_GNSSDual.fit # Fit file with the data field
        field: enhanced_altitude # data field to include in the customer graph
        label: Altitude baro # label of the field fir this file
      - file: GarminFenix8_WahooTRACKR_GNSSDual.fit 
        field: GPS altitude
        label: Altitude GPS
GarminFenix8_WahooTRACKR_GNSSDual.fit: # options for each fit files
  delta: 0 # delta in second ti apply to the timestamps of this file (can be positive or negative int value)
AppleWatchSeries10_OHR_GNSS.fit:
  delta: 0
